<h1>Chess Game</h1>

<p>Hi there! Welcome to the official repository of this Chess game handcrafted by me!</p>
<br>
<p>Here you can generate a link to a room and invite friends over to a game of chess!</p>
<br>
<p>I used <strong>socket programming</strong> using socket.io for the logic of rooms and real time updates of moves on the chess board.</p>
<br>
<p>The frontend is in React, the backend is written in Express (NodeJS). <br>
I have used JWTs for authentication of users and MongoDB as a database for storing the user and game related info</p>
